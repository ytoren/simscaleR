Description: Similarity matix calculations tools: 
    * Thresholds & sparsity: The ability to add a minimal similarity threshold and store sparse structures (instead of the full dense similarity matrix).
    * Smart parallelisation: Control over the distribution of the calculation, from single-machine to fully distributed (with some smart compromises).
    * Domain knowledge "injection": How to combine external information on groups of items that are similar.
