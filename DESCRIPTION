Title: Large scale similarity calculations
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This package calculates similarity with some considerations for large scale: 
    * The ability to add a minimal similarity threshold and store sparse structures (instead of the full dense similarity structure).
    * Control over the distribution of the calculation: from single-machine to fully distributed (with some smart compromises).
    * "Injection" of domain knowledge, in the form of external information on groups of items that are similar.
