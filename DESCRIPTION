Title: Large scale similarity calculations
Version: 0.1.0
Author: person("Yizhar (Izzy)", "Toren", email = "ytoren@gmail.com", role=c('cre','aut'))
Maintainer: Yizhar (Izzy) Toren <ytoren+cran@gmail.com>
Description: This package calculates similarity with some considerations for large scale: 
    * The ability to add a minimal similarity threshold and store sparse structures (instead of the full dense similarity structure).
    * Control over the distribution of the calculation: from single-machine to fully distributed (with some smart compromises).
